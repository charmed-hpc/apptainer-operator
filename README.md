A [Juju](https://juju.is) charm for automating the full lifecycle operations of 
[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org), a secure and portable container platform designed 
for ease-of-use on shared systems and high-performance computing (HPC) environments.

## ✨ Getting Started

To deploy the Apptainer operator, you'll need to integrate it with a principal charm:

```shell
juju deploy ubuntu --base ubuntu@24.04
juju deploy apptainer --channel edge
juju integrate apptainer ubuntu
```

You can use `juju status` to inspect the deployment status with:

```text
$ juju status
Model              Controller              Cloud/Region         Version  SLA          Timestamp
apptainer          charmed-hpc-controller  localhost/localhost  3.6.7    unsupported  14:15:39-04:00

App        Version  Status  Scale  Charm      Channel        Rev  Exposed  Message
apptainer  1.3.4    active      1  apptainer                   0  no       
ubuntu     24.04    active      1  ubuntu     latest/stable   26  no

  apptainer/0*  active    idle            10.196.162.159         

Machine  State    Address         Inst id        Base          AZ  Message
0        started  10.196.162.159  juju-a3584f-0  ubuntu@24.04      Running
```

Now you can run container images using Apptainer:

```shell
$ juju ssh apptainer/0 -- apptainer exec docker://ubuntu/python:3.10-22.04 python3 --version
juju ssh apptainer/0 -- apptainer exec docker://ubuntu/python:3.10-22.04 python3 --version

## 🛠️ Development

The project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for
development, which provides some useful commands that will help you while hacking on the Apptainer operator:

```shell
just fmt            # Apply formatting standards to code.
just lint           # Check code against coding style standards.
just woke           # Run inclusive naming checks.
just typecheck      # Run static type checks.
just unit           # Run unit tests.
```

To run the Apptainer operator integration tests, you'll need to have both
[Juju](https://juju.is) and [LXD](https://ubuntu.com/lxd) installed
on your machine:

```shell
just integration    # Run integration tests.
```
