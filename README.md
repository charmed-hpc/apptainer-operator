A [Juju](https://juju.is) charm for automating the full lifecycle operations of 
[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org), a secure and portable container platform designed 
for ease-of-use on shared systems and high-performance computing (HPC) environments.

## ‚ú® Getting Started

To deploy the Apptainer operator, you'll need to integrate it with a principal charm:

```shell
juju deploy ubuntu --base ubuntu@24.04
juju deploy apptainer --channel edge
juju integrate apptainer ubuntu
```

You can use `juju status` to inspect the deployment status with:

```text
$ juju status
Model              Controller              Cloud/Region         Version  SLA          Timestamp
apptainer          charmed-hpc-controller  localhost/localhost  3.6.7    unsupported  14:15:39-04:00

App        Version  Status  Scale  Charm      Channel        Rev  Exposed  Message
apptainer  1.3.4    active      1  apptainer                   0  no       
ubuntu     24.04    active      1  ubuntu     latest/stable   26  no       

Unit            Workload  Agent  Machine  Public address  Ports  Message
ubuntu/0*       active    idle   0        10.196.162.159         
  apptainer/0*  active    idle            10.196.162.159         

Machine  State    Address         Inst id        Base          AZ  Message
0        started  10.196.162.159  juju-a3584f-0  ubuntu@24.04      Running
```

Now you can run container images using Apptainer:

```shell
$ juju ssh apptainer/0 -- apptainer exec docker://ubuntu/python:3.10-22.04 python3 --version
juju ssh apptainer/0 -- apptainer exec docker://ubuntu/python:3.10-22.04 python3 --version

If you want to learn more about all the things you can do with the Apptainer operator,
or have any further questions on what you can do with the operator, here are some
further resources for you to explore:

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for
development, which provides some useful commands that will help you while hacking on the Apptainer operator:

```shell
just fmt            # Apply formatting standards to code.
just lint           # Check code against coding style standards.
just woke           # Run inclusive naming checks.
just typecheck      # Run static type checks.
just unit           # Run unit tests.
```

To run the Apptainer operator integration tests, you'll need to have both
[Juju](https://juju.is) and [LXD](https://ubuntu.com/lxd) installed
on your machine:

```shell
just integration    # Run integration tests.
```
